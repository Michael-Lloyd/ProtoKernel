PROTOKERNEL GDB DEBUGGING
=========================

## Quick Start

The main debugging tool is `scripts/debug-qemu.sh` which launches QEMU with GDB server and connects GDB with your chosen script:

./scripts/debug-qemu.sh <gdb-script>

## Creating Custom Debug Scripts

1. Create a new .gdb file in the scripts/ directory
2. Don't include `target remote :1234` - debug-qemu.sh handles connection
3. Use physical addresses for breakpoints during boot phase
4. Include clear echo statements to track progress
5. Always end with `quit` if the script should exit automatically
