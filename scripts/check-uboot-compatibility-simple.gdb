echo \n=== 1. BOOT PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE ===\n
echo ARM64 Linux Boot Protocol register check:\n
echo   x0 (DTB): 
output/x $x0
echo \n
echo   x1-x3 (should be 0): 
output/x $x1
echo , 
output/x $x2
echo , 
output/x $x3
echo \n

if $x1 == 0 && $x2 == 0 && $x3 == 0
  echo ✓ Boot protocol registers correct\n
else
  echo ✗ WARNING: Non-zero values in reserved registers\n
end

echo \n=== 2. CRITICAL MEMORY LOCATIONS ===\n
echo Kernel load address: 0x40080000\n
echo Page tables start: 0x40077000 (9 pages before kernel)\n
echo \n⚠️  WARNING: Page tables are placed BEFORE kernel!\n
echo This could be problematic with U-Boot because:\n
echo - U-Boot loads kernel at specified address\n
echo - Memory before that address may not be reserved\n
echo - Page tables could be overwritten by U-Boot or UEFI\n

echo \n=== 3. DTB HANDLING ===\n
# Step through DTB preservation
stepi
stepi
stepi
stepi
echo \nDTB saved to x27: 
output/x $x27
echo \n
if $x27 == $x0
  echo ✓ DTB pointer preserved\n
else
  echo ✗ DTB pointer not preserved correctly\n
end

echo \n=== 4. REQUIRED FIXES FOR U-BOOT ===\n
echo \n1. PAGE TABLE LOCATION (CRITICAL):\n
echo   Current: Places 9 pages BEFORE kernel\n
echo   Problem: U-Boot doesn't know about this requirement\n
echo   Fix: Allocate page tables AFTER kernel image\n
echo \n2. LINUX IMAGE HEADER (RECOMMENDED):\n
echo   Current: No header\n
echo   Problem: Cannot use 'booti' command\n
echo   Fix: Add 64-byte Image header at start\n
echo \n3. MEMORY ASSUMPTIONS:\n
echo   Current: Assumes memory layout\n
echo   Problem: May not work on all systems\n
echo   Fix: Use DTB to discover memory\n

echo \n=== 5. U-BOOT LOADING COMMANDS ===\n
echo \nCurrently supported:\n
echo   go 0x40080000 - 0x48000000\n
echo   (manually specify DTB address)\n
echo \nNOT supported:\n
echo   booti (requires Image header)\n

echo \n=== CONCLUSION ===\n
echo The kernel will likely FAIL with U-Boot due to:\n
echo ✗ Page tables placed before kernel load address\n
echo \nMinimal fix needed:\n
echo → Move page table allocation after kernel image\n
