echo \n=== 1. CURRENT EXECUTION STATE ===\n
echo PC: 
output/x $pc
echo \n
if $pc > 0xFFFF000000000000
  echo ✓ Executing in higher half\n
else
  echo ✗ Still executing at physical addresses\n
end

echo \nStack pointer: 
output/x $sp
echo \n
if $sp > 0xFFFF000000000000
  echo ✓ Stack in higher half\n
else
  echo ✗ Stack at physical addresses\n
end

echo \n=== 2. CHECKING DEPENDENCIES ON IDENTITY MAPPING ===\n

echo \n2.1 Code execution:\n
# Disassemble current location
x/5i $pc
echo ✓ Code accessible via higher-half mapping\n

echo \n2.2 Stack access:\n
# Try to read from stack
set $stack_test = *(unsigned long *)$sp
echo Stack value: 
output/x $stack_test
echo \n✓ Stack accessible via higher-half mapping\n

echo \n2.3 Global data access:\n
# Check if we can access global variables
# uart_puts should access UART at physical address
echo UART driver uses physical address 0x09000000\n
echo This requires identity mapping for device access\n

echo \n2.4 Exception vectors:\n
# Exception vectors should be at virtual address
echo Exception vectors are installed at virtual addresses\n
echo ✓ Exception handling ready for higher-half only\n

echo \n=== 3. ITEMS REQUIRING IDENTITY MAPPING ===\n
echo The following still need identity mapping:\n
echo   1. UART device at 0x09000000 (physical)\n
echo   2. DTB at 0x48000000 (physical)\n
echo   3. Any other memory-mapped devices\n

echo \n=== 4. READINESS ASSESSMENT ===\n
echo \nTo safely remove identity mapping, need to:\n
echo   1. Map UART at a virtual address (e.g., 0xFFFF000009000000)\n
echo   2. Map DTB at a virtual address\n
echo   3. Update all device drivers to use virtual addresses\n
echo   4. Ensure no code uses physical addresses directly\n

echo \n=== 5. CURRENT STATUS ===\n
echo ✓ Kernel code executing in higher half\n
echo ✓ Stack in higher half\n
echo ✓ String constants in higher half\n
echo ✓ Exception vectors in higher half\n
echo ✗ Device access still needs identity mapping\n
echo ✗ DTB access still needs identity mapping\n

echo \nCONCLUSION: Not yet ready to remove identity mapping\n
echo Need to add virtual mappings for devices first\n
