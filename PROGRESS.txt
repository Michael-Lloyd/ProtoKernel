HIGHER-HALF KERNEL IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS
==========================================

Last Updated: 2025-07-24
Current Status: Part A (Identity Mapping) COMPLETE

## Overview
We are implementing a higher-half kernel for 64-bit ARM (AArch64). The kernel will be loaded at a low physical address but run at high virtual addresses (0xFFFF_xxxx_xxxx_xxxx range).

## Critical Addresses and Constants

### Load Addresses
- **QEMU Load Address**: 0x40080000 (where QEMU's -kernel option loads our binary)
- **Expected Physical Base**: 0x40200000 (defined in linker script as KERNEL_PHYS_BASE)
- **Virtual Base**: 0xFFFF000040200000 (defined as KERNEL_VIRT_BASE)
- **Kernel Size**: ~40KB currently

### Page Table Configuration
- **Page Size**: 4KB (4096 bytes)
- **Granule**: 4KB
- **VA Space**: 48-bit
- **Page Table Levels**: 4 (L0, L1, L2, L3)
- **Entries per Table**: 512

### Memory Layout
- **Page Tables Location**: 9 pages before kernel (0x40077000 when kernel at 0x40080000)
  - L0 TTBR0: 0x40077000 (1 page)
  - L1 TTBR0: 0x40078000 (1 page)
  - L2 TTBR0 (first 512MB): 0x40079000 (1 page)
  - L2 TTBR0 (second 512MB): 0x4007A000 (1 page)
  - Space for TTBR1 tables: 5 pages reserved

### Page Table Entry Formats
- **Valid bit**: bit 0
- **Table/Block descriptor**: bits 0-1 (0x3 for table, 0x1 for block)
- **AttrIndx**: bits 2-4 (MAIR index)
- **AP**: bits 6-7 (Access Permissions)
- **SH**: bits 8-9 (Shareability)
- **AF**: bit 10 (Access Flag)
- **nG**: bit 11 (not Global)
- **Physical Address**: bits vary by level

## Completed Work

### 1. Boot Code Structure (arch/arm64/boot.S)
- Exception level handling (EL3 -> EL2 -> EL1)
- Physical address calculation (handles QEMU's load address)
- Page table memory allocation and clearing
- Identity mapping creation for first 1GB of physical memory
- MMU configuration and enable
- Basic function calling after MMU enable

### 2. Identity Mapping Implementation
Successfully creates identity mapping (VA = PA) for bootstrap:
- **Coverage**: First 1GB of physical memory
- **Granularity**: 2MB blocks at L2 level
- **Attributes**: Normal memory, Inner/Outer Write-Back, RW at EL1

Page table structure created:
```
L0[0] -> L1 table
  L1[0] -> L2 table (covers 0-512MB)
    L2[0-255]: 2MB blocks mapping 0x00000000-0x1FFFFFFF
  L1[1] -> L2 table (covers 512MB-1GB) 
    L2[0-255]: 2MB blocks mapping 0x40000000-0x5FFFFFFF
```

### 3. MMU Configuration
- **MAIR_EL1**: 0xFF (Index 0 = Normal memory WB-WA)
- **TCR_EL1**: 
  - T0SZ = 16 (48-bit addresses)
  - TG0 = 0 (4KB granule)
  - SH0 = 3 (Inner shareable)
  - ORGN0/IRGN0 = 1 (Write-back, write-allocate)
- **SCTLR_EL1**: M=1, C=1, I=1 (MMU, D-cache, I-cache enabled)

### 4. Test Results
- Page tables correctly set up at 0x40077000
- Identity mapping verified for kernel region
- MMU successfully enabled
- Execution continues after MMU enable
- Currently hangs before reaching kernel_main
- When kernel_main is reached (in earlier tests), it attempts to access virtual addresses which fail (expected - no higher-half mapping yet)

## Completed Steps

### Step 2B: Create Higher-Half Mapping (TTBR1) - COMPLETE
1. Allocated page tables for TTBR1 at physical addresses:
   - L0: 0x4007b000
   - L1: 0x4007c000  
   - L2: 0x4007d000
2. Created mapping from 0xFFFF000040080000 -> 0x40080000
   - Changed virtual base to align with QEMU load address
   - L0[0x1FE] -> L1 table
   - L1[1] -> L2 table
   - L2[0-31] -> 32 x 2MB blocks mapping 64MB
3. Configured TCR_EL1 for both TTBR0 and TTBR1
   - T0SZ = T1SZ = 16 (48-bit addresses)
   - 4KB granule, inner shareable, write-back cached
4. Set TTBR1_EL1 to point to higher-half L0 table
5. Verified with comprehensive GDB tests:
   - Page table walk shows correct structure
   - Virtual to physical mapping verified
   - Attributes correct (RW, normal memory)

## Current State

The kernel now:
- Boots and sets up identity mapping (TTBR0) - WORKING
- Sets up higher-half mapping (TTBR1) - COMPLETE
- Enables MMU with both mappings active
- Continues execution at physical addresses (identity mapped)
- Higher-half page tables ready but not yet used for execution
- Can reach kernel_main successfully

## Verification Results (2025-07-24)

Comprehensive testing confirms:
1. Identity mapping works correctly
   - Can read/write all memory regions
   - Page tables at 0x40077000 are valid
   - Execution proceeds normally

2. Higher-half mapping is set up correctly
   - TTBR1_EL1 points to 0x4007b000
   - L0[0x1FE] entry is valid and points to L1
   - Full page table hierarchy verified
   - Maps virtual 0xFFFF000040080000 to physical 0x40080000

3. Minor issue found:
   - Register x19 (DTB pointer) gets overwritten during page table setup
   - This causes kernel_main to receive wrong parameter
   - Not critical for current implementation phase

4. Expected behavior confirmed:
   - kernel_main faults when accessing virtual addresses
   - This is correct - we haven't jumped to higher half yet

## Next Steps for Higher-Half Implementation

### Step 3: Jump to Higher Half
1. After MMU enable with both mappings active
2. Load higher-half address of next instruction
3. Use indirect branch to jump
4. Update stack pointer to virtual address
5. Clear BSS using virtual addresses

### Step 4: Remove Identity Mapping
1. After running in higher half
2. Clear TTBR0 or unmap identity regions
3. Implement in C code after kernel_main starts

## Current Issues

### Virtual Address Access in kernel_main
After enabling the MMU with identity mapping, the kernel successfully:
- Enables the MMU with identity mapping
- Sets up the stack pointer at 0x40070000
- Jumps to kernel_main at physical address 0x40081a80

However, kernel_main immediately faults when trying to load a string constant because:
- The kernel is compiled to use virtual addresses (0xFFFF000040200000 range)
- kernel_main tries to load from address 0xffff0000402042e8 (a string constant)
- We only have identity mapping (PA = VA), no higher-half mapping yet
- The access to unmapped virtual address causes an exception (jumps to 0x200)

This is expected behavior since the kernel is compiled for higher-half addresses but we haven't 
implemented that mapping yet. The solution is to implement Step 2B: Create Higher-Half Mapping.

## Important Notes

### FreeBSD Comparison
The reference FreeBSD locore.S implementation is very sensitive to:
- Exact sequence of operations
- Barrier instructions (ISB, DSB)
- Register preservation across operations
- TLB invalidation timing

### Common Pitfalls Encountered
1. **Load Address Mismatch**: QEMU loads at 0x40080000, not 0x40200000
2. **L1 Index Calculation**: Kernel at 0x40080000 needs L1[1], not L1[0]
3. **MMU Reconfiguration**: Cannot change TTBR0 while MMU is enabled with it
4. **Virtual Address Access**: Any access to virtual addresses fails without mapping

### Debugging Commands
Useful GDB commands for debugging:
```gdb
# Check page table entry
x/gx <table_base> + (<index> * 8)

# Walk page tables for an address
set $l0_idx = (<addr> >> 39) & 0x1FF
set $l1_idx = (<addr> >> 30) & 0x1FF  
set $l2_idx = (<addr> >> 21) & 0x1FF
```

### Memory Attributes
Current implementation uses simple attributes:
- 0x701: Block entry, AF=1, SH=Inner, AttrIndx=0, AP=RW_EL1
- Consider using different attributes for code vs data in higher-half mapping

## Files Modified
- arch/arm64/boot.S: Main implementation
- arch/arm64/linker.ld: Defines KERNEL_PHYS_BASE and KERNEL_VIRT_BASE
- scripts/: Various GDB test scripts for verification

## Testing
Run with: `./scripts/debug-qemu.sh scripts/verify-identity-map.gdb`
Current kernel size: 40960 bytes

The identity mapping phase is complete and working correctly. Ready for higher-half mapping implementation.
